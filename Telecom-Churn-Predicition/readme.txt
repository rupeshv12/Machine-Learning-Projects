# Exact problem:
* Need to find out customer who are leaving the platform soon 
* Main goal is to retain them as getting new customer is a very costly process(invloves lot of resources like prmotion,            discounts etc)
* Prime customer and customer who left the platform are not our concern

#Convert business problem(increase revenue) to mathematical problem(reduce churn rate)

# Who are my customer:
* Individual Consumers having various facilities like PhoneService, InternetService, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies,                 DeviceProtection, Online backup etc
# Model is supervised or unsupervised:
* we are finding customer churn (YES/NO) : Classification problem - supervised ML
# Where data is coming:
* We will answer this later - (like data is coming from various tables from telecom dataset using join )
# End product visibility:
* We will create an app which will accept customer data and let us know wheter customer is leaving or not
# Team Member Count: 3
# End Goal: Reduce churn rate
