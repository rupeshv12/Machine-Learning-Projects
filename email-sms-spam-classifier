This project is being used to handle spam messages from EMAIL/SMS
We will use NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP. 
A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. 
Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it using NLTK

We are building machine learning program containing various classifier algorithm to test the accuracy and precision 

Suitable algorithim we will use for deployment using Streamlit
